# Maven-Roasters-Brewlytics-Dashboard-in-Excel


#### **Business Need**
Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City (Reflex, Flat Kicker, and Lower Manhattan), wanted to gain a deeper understanding of their transactional data. The goal was to identify purchase patterns, trends, and opportunities for improving operations and enhancing customer experience. 

To achieve this, Maven Roasters needed a **dynamic dashboard** that could:
1. Visualize key business metrics such as revenue, transaction patterns, and product performance.
2. Provide insights into customer behavior by analyzing trends by location, time, and product category.
3. Assist in making data-driven decisions to optimize sales and improve profitability.

### **Goals of the Project**
1. **Data Profiling and Preparation**: Clean and structure the raw transactional data collected from January to June 2023 to make it suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use pivot tables and charts to explore the data and identify patterns or anomalies.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Build an interactive dashboard in Excel to allow franchise owners and managers to:
   - Analyze revenue by month, day, and hour.
   - Evaluate top-performing product categories and items.
   - Compare performance across different store locations.

### **Process for Discovering and Presenting Insights**
#### **1. Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Raw Data Profiling**: Examined the dataset to understand its structure (e.g., transaction dates, product categories, revenue, and store locations).
   - **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, fixed missing values, and formatted data into tables for pivot table analysis.
   - **Transformation**: Aggregated data into relevant metrics (e.g., total revenue by month, transactions by product category).

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - **Pivot Tables**: Created to summarize data along key dimensions like date, store location, product type, and hour of the day.
   - **Visualization**: Used pivot charts to make findings more digestible:
     - **Line Chart**: Revenue by month to observe seasonal trends.
     - **Bar Charts**: Transactions by day of the week, hour of the day, and product categories to highlight busy periods and popular items.

#### **3. Building the Dashboard**
   - Assembled the charts into a single, cohesive layout.
   - Added slicers for interactivity, allowing users to filter by store location and dynamically update all visualizations.
   - Applied formatting, alignment, and aesthetics to create a professional and user-friendly design.

#### **4. Insights and Recommendations**
   - **Revenue Trends**: Identified that revenue increased steadily from January to June, possibly reflecting seasonal demand or marketing efforts.
   - **Peak Times**: Noted that transactions peaked on weekends and during certain hours of the day (e.g., morning coffee rush).
   - **Product Performance**: Coffee was the top-selling category, while other items (e.g., bakery items) contributed significantly to incremental revenue.
   - **Store-Specific Analysis**: Observed differences in performance across locations, which could guide targeted strategies (e.g., promotions or staffing).

### **Meaningful Insights & Recommendations**
Based on your analysis, the following actionable insights were derived:
1. **Optimize Staffing**: Align employee schedules with peak hours and days (e.g., weekends and morning hours).
2. **Promote High-Margin Products**: Focus on marketing top-performing product categories (e.g., coffee and baked goods).
3. **Location-Specific Strategies**: Tailor promotions and inventory for each store, leveraging the slicer functionality to monitor specific needs.
4. **Encourage Repeat Business**: Introduce loyalty programs or discounts during off-peak hours to boost transactions.

### **Outcome**
This project successfully transformed raw data into a valuable decision-making tool. The interactive dashboard empowers stakeholders to:
- Gain a holistic view of the businessâ€™s performance.
- Discover patterns and trends effortlessly.
- Make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and profitability. 

This project not only addressed the immediate needs of Maven Roasters but also established a scalable framework for future analyses.
